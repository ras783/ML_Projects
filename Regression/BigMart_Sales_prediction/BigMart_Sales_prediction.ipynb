Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.\n","\n","Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales.\n","\n","Please note that the data may have missing values as some stores might not report all the data due to technical glitches. Hence, it will be required to treat them accordingly. \n","\n","\n","\n","# Data Description\n","We have train (8523) and test (5681) data set, train data set has both input and output variable(s).

City type: Stores located in urban or Tier 1 cities should have higher sales because of the higher income levels of people there.\n","2.

Store Capacity: Stores which are very big in size should have higher sales as they act like one-stop-shops and people would prefer getting everything from one place\n","4. Competitors: Stores having similar establishments nearby should have less sales because of more competition.\n","5. Marketing: Stores which have a good marketing division should have higher sales as it will be able to attract customers through the right offers and advertising.\n","6.

Utility: Daily use products should have a higher tendency to sell as compared to the specific use products.\n","4. Display Area: Products which are given bigger shelves in the store are likely to catch attention first and sell more.\n","5. Visibility in Store: The location of product in a store will impact sales. Ones which are right at entrance will catch the eye of customer first rather than the ones in back.\n","6. Advertising: Better advertising of products in the store will should higher sales in most cases.\n","7. Promotional Offers: Products accompanied with attractive offers and discounts will sell more."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HI05Iv8bK9Fc","colab_type":"text"},"source":["#2.
